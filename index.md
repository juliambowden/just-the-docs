Fertig Lab Onboarding Guide and Information

## Mission Statement

Our purpose is to invent and apply novel bioinformatics algorithms that reflect the complexity of biological systems. While our primary focus is applications to cancer biology, we are ultimately directed by the study of biology and complex diseases. We approach our work with the utmost respect and appreciation for the patients and healthy volunteers who agree to participate in our research and strive to seek answers that will inform better therapeutic approaches and knowledge. We are conscientious, rigorous and collegial members of our scientific and clinical communities; as such we will always share openly our data and resources to the fullest extent possible. The lab is dedicated to reproducible research. All code is to be shared as supplemental files with publications or through code databases, such as GitHub, Sourceforge, Bioconductor, etc.
